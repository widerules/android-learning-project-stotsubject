I don't know whether you has the same problem with me or nor(it's alright if not:D) but I wanna share this problem to you.
I have tried adding the addons from
> http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/     and
> https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
and I see **this error**:
"Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not
be found"
So **the resolution** is:
Install new, updated softwares firstly:
Eclipse GEF   - http://download.eclipse.org/tools/gef/updates/releases/
Eclipse EMF   - http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/
Eclipse GMF   - http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/gmf/updates/releases
Eclipse Webtools - http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/updates/
Google eclipse Plugin - http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.5
Then downloading Developper Tools from
> http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
Have a great day, boys!
